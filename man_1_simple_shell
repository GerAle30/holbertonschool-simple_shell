.SH NAME
simple_shell \- simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shell
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that reads commands from standard input and executes them.
It provides basic functionality similar to the standard shell, including the execution of external commands
by searching the PATH environment variable.
.PP
When invoked, the shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command. The command line
is read, parsed, and then executed. This process is repeated until the user exits the shell.
.SH FEATURES
.TP
.B Interactive Mode
When shell is connected to a terminal, it operates in interactive mode. In this mode, it displays a prompt
.B ($)
before reading each command.
.TP
.B Non-Interactive Mode
When shell receives its input from a pipe or a file, it processes commands without displaying a prompt.
.TP
.B Command Execution
Commands are executed by searching for the executable in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
If the command contains a forward slash ('/'), the shell will attempt to execute it directly without searching PATH.
.TP
.B Built-in Commands
The following built-in commands are supported:
.RS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell with the status of the last executed command, or with a specified exit status.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of the shell is the exit status of the last command executed. If the command is not found,
the exit status is 127. If the command is found but not executable, the exit status is determined by the system error.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
List of directories to search for commands, colon-separated.
